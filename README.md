# Disaster-Tweet-Classification-using-NLP
This project focuses on classifying tweets to determine whether they are related to real disasters or not. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the model analyzes tweet text and predicts if it indicates a disaster situation.
This project demonstrates skills in **text preprocessing, feature extraction, and supervised learning**.

## Dataset

* **Type:** Twitter text data
* **Format:** CSV
* **Key Columns:**

  * `text` – Tweet content
  * `target` – Label (1: Disaster, 0: Not Disaster)

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)

---

## Approach

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing

   * Lowercasing
   * Removing punctuation and stopwords
2. Text vectorization (Bag of Words / TF-IDF)
3. Model training using machine learning algorithms
4. Model evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics
